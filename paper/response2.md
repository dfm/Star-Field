I am prepared to accept this paper once you have submitted a revision that addresses these few points.  I should also add that I agree with the referee's point regarding how to more effectively reach astronomers.

Reviewer's Comments:
I believe all my comments were adequately addressed. I note that the left ~15% of the new figure 6 is missing in the revised pdf file.

I have a remaining minor comment: the figure captions could be expanded a bit to be a more stand-alone explanation of figures. Fig. 6 in particular triggered this comment: for example, it's not clear from the caption what is "x", and "x" is also used in figs. 1 and 5 with an entirely different meaning. Another minor comment: as an astronomer I am very interested in your results and their importance - yet, I think there is a bit of oversell when fig. 6 has the lower limit on x axis of 0.1 because the extremely faint part is (over)emphasized, while the most interesting part (in practice) is 1 < x < 10. If I were Bertin (and I am not), I might say "I see that for x>4 we completely agree, and everyone detects to SNR=5 anyway, so what is the big deal?". I am not trying to diminish the significance of your work - I do like it a lot and think it will become well known - I am simply thinking of how to better socialize your main results with card-carrying astronomers.
