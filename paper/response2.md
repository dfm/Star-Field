Dear Dr. Gallagher,

Thank you for providing the second referee's report on our manuscript AJ-11369
entitled "Probabilistic Catalogs for Crowded Stellar Fields". We are very
pleased that the referee is happy with the revised version of the paper.

We have made some changes to address the remaining minor issues raised by
the referee. Details are provided below.

Regards,

==================

"I have a remaining minor comment: the figure captions could be expanded a bit to be a more stand-alone explanation of figures."

- We have expanded most figure captions with extra reminders about what is being displayed.

"Fig. 6 in particular triggered this comment: for example, it's not clear from the caption what is "x", and "x" is also used in figs. 1 and 5 with an entirely different meaning."

- x is a dummy variable for flux. We have renamed it to f to prevent confusion.

"Another minor comment: as an astronomer I am very interested in your results and their importance - yet, I think there is a bit of oversell when fig. 6 has the lower limit on x axis of 0.1 because the extremely faint part is (over)emphasized, while the most interesting part (in practice) is 1 < x < 10. If I were Bertin (and I am not), I might say "I see that for x>4 we completely agree, and everyone detects to SNR=5 anyway, so what is the big deal?"

- Fair enough. We do like that the flat part of the curve is recovered
well (this corresponds to being able to measure the parameter h_1), so we would
like to retain some of it in this figure. We do now show less of it though.
We have also tidied up the figure so it uses the same fonts as the other figures
and also ensured that it fits inside the page in the PDF version.

Reviewer's Comments:
I believe all my comments were adequately addressed. I note that the left ~15% of the new figure 6 is missing in the revised pdf file.

I have a remaining minor comment: the figure captions could be expanded a bit to be a more stand-alone explanation of figures. Fig. 6 in particular triggered this comment: for example, it's not clear from the caption what is "x", and "x" is also used in figs. 1 and 5 with an entirely different meaning. Another minor comment: as an astronomer I am very interested in your results and their importance - yet, I think there is a bit of oversell when fig. 6 has the lower limit on x axis of 0.1 because the extremely faint part is (over)emphasized, while the most interesting part (in practice) is 1 < x < 10. If I were Bertin (and I am not), I might say "I see that for x>4 we completely agree, and everyone detects to SNR=5 anyway, so what is the big deal?". I am not trying to diminish the significance of your work - I do like it a lot and think it will become well known - I am simply thinking of how to better socialize your main results with card-carrying astronomers.
